TradeSpace is Now Public: Code, License, and a Push Towards Transparency

## ðŸš€ Opening TradeSpace to the World

Today marks a major step in how I build â€” not just in code, but in public.

TradeSpace, my AI-powered market advisor built with Python, Django, and OpenAI, is now available on GitHub:

## âœ… What we did

- Published the complete codebase of TradeSpace as an open MVP
- Added a proper README with instructions and dependencies
- Chose the MIT license â€” because ideas should grow freely
- Cleaned and structured the project for others to explore
- Built a custom PowerShell script to automate git push operations

## ðŸ’¡ Why it matters

Transparency matters.
Visibility builds trust.
Ideas get stronger when shared â€” and thatâ€™s exactly what this is.

Whether you're a developer, investor, or curious builder â€” you can now see what TradeSpace is made of, clone it, run it, improve it, or contribute to it.

## ðŸ”œ What's next

- Weekly updates as we evolve the MVP
- Blog posts covering architecture and strategies
- UI and interaction refinements
- Preparing for monetization, integration, and real-world testing

**Building in public isn't just a strategy â€” it's a statement.
What it takes is consistency. This is Day 1.**
