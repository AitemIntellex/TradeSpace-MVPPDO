# 🔧 Telegram Notification for Live Server Activity

📣 Don't just say what you can do — **show what you've done**.

Today, we're connecting our server environment to our Telegram channel.
Not for everything — but just enough to **show the system is alive**.

---

## ✅ Objective

When we perform key actions on our server — like:

- Starting the Django server
- Running `git push`
- Executing trade simulations

...our Telegram bot will send a short notification to the channel.
This bridges the **backend world** with the **public eye**.

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- Python
- Telegram Bot API
- PowerShell
- `requests` library

---

📍 Next step: test it live.

Stay tuned.
